## Basics

RcppNT2 provides a number of helper functions, to make
high-level use of **NT<sup>2</sup>** easy. These come in the
form of algorithms provided in the `RcppNT2` namespace:

| Algorithm       | Transformation       |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| `simdTransform` | `vector` -> `vector` |
| `simdReduce`    | `vector` -> `scalar` |
| `simdFor`       | `vector` -> `any`    |

These can be called in a similar manner to their counterparts
in the standard library. Let's investigate how these can be
used.

### A Simple Example

Let's look at how we could compute the sum of a vector of
numbers the RcppNT2 way. We can express this operation as
a reduction; e.g. by successively applying `lhs + rhs`
over the sequence. RcppNT2 provides the `simdReduce()`
function for accomplishing this sort of reduction.
Suppose we had a vector of `double`s, call it `data`.
We could express this computation as:

```cpp
double total = simdReduce(pbegin(data),
                          pend(data),
                          0.0,
                          functor::plus());
```

The `pbegin` function is a helper function provided by 
RcppNT2, and provides pointers (rather than iterators) to 
the beginning and end of a block of data.  `functor::plus()`
is a helper functor that can be used with `simdReduce()`.
It's implementation is simply:

```cpp
struct plus {
    template <typename T>
    T operator()(const T& lhs, const T& rhs)
    {
        return lhs + rhs;
    }
};
```

This illustrates some of the basics as to how an algorithm
can be implemented in the RcppNT2 way:

1. Choose an appropriate RcppNT2 algorithm (in this case,
   `simdReduce()`),

2. Write a class with a templated call operator, with its
   implementation written using functions provided by
   `nt2` whenever possible.

Behind the scenes, the compiler will emit two specializations
for the templated call operator: one with `T = double`,
accepting the scalar case, and one with `T = boost::simd::pack<double>`,
to allow for vectorized SIMD operations when possible, with
fallbacks for the scalar case when not. Because all `nt2`
functions can operate with both scalars and packed values,
the compiler will generate optimal code, and you only need
to write a single implementation.

## Variadic Algorithms

The `simd*` algorithms provided by RcppNT2 accept up to
2 vectors, depending on the computation. What if you want
to handle 3 or more vectors at once?

RcppNT2 provides a number of variadic versions of these 
functors as well, within the `variadic` namespace. Suppose 
you wanted to write a function that computed the scalar
product of three vectors, e.g. `sum(x * y * z)`. You could
express the `DotProduct` using a stateful functor in `RcppNT2`
as:

```cpp
struct DotProduct
{
  template <typename T>
  void operator()(const T& x, const T& y, const T& z)
  {
    result_ = nt2::sum(x * y * z);
  }
  
  operator double() const { return result_; }
  double result_ = 0.0;
}
```

And this could then be called with:

```cpp
double result = variadic::simdFor(DotProduct(), x, y, z);
```

RcppNT2 will take your functor, apply its call operator
across each of the vectors passed in, and then return the
result.

## Handling NAs

By default, all of the functions provided by **NT<sup>2</sup>**
will propagate missing values (`NA` and `NaN`s). If you need
to write an implementation that handles (omits) missing
values, there are a couple tools available within RcppNT2
that can help. The general idea is this:

1. Use the `na::mask()` function to compute an NA bitmask
   from a vector that contains missing values. The vector
   will be filled with values that are bitwise 1 when
   missing, and bitwise 0 when present. Call this vector the
   'NA mask'.

2. Pass the NA mask vector along with any of your SIMD
   algorithms, and use `nt2::bitwise_and()` to apply and
   mask out missing values as appropriate.

See [this example](https://github.com/RcppCore/RcppNT2/blob/master/inst/examples/example-na-handling-variance.cpp) for motivation in how missing values
can be handled in computation of the variance, without
giving up the optimizations borne from SIMD instructions.

## Caveats

There are a number of things to keep in mind when writing
your templated functors:

- The **NT<sup>2</sup>** functions are stricter about types,
  especially with literals. If you are working with a
  function that expects `double`s, be sure to pass a `double`
  (e.g. `0.0` vs `0`) as otherwise type deduction can fail.
