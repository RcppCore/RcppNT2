RcppNT2
=======

## Overview

The [Numerical Template Toolbox (NT<sup>2</sup>)](https://github.com/jfalcou/nt2)
is an Open Source C++ library aimed at simplifying the development, debugging
and optimization of high-performance computing applications by providing a
Matlab like syntax that eases the transition between prototype and actual
application.

`RcppNT2` bundles the `NT<sup>2</sup>` library, and provides a number of helper
wrappers, to make it easy to use in your own R packages.
