<h1 class="title">RcppNT2</h1>

RcppNT2 provides bindings to the
[**Numerical Template Toolbox**](https://github.com/jfalcou/nt2)
(**NT<sup>2</sup>**).

## Overview

**NT<sup>2</sup>** is an open source C++ library aimed at
simplifying
the development, debugging and optimization of
high-performance computing applications by providing a
Matlab-like syntax that eases the transition between
prototype and actual application.

**NT<sub>2</sub>** provides with a large toolbox of algorithms,
facilitating scientific computing for many tasks. Browse the
[User Manual](http://nt2.metascale.fr/doc/html/user_manual0.html)
to get an overview of what functions are provided by
**NT<sub>2</sub>**. By including `<RcppNT2.h>`, these functions
are all made available as part of the `nt2` namespace, and so are
immediately ready to use.

## Examples

RcppNT2 provides a number of helper functions, to make high-level
use of **NT<sup>2</sup>** easy. These come in the form of
algorithms provided in the `RcppNT2` namespace:

| Algorithm       | Transformation       |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| `simdTransform` | `vector` -> `vector` |
| `simdReduce`    | `vector` -> `scalar` |
| `simdFor`       | `vector` -> `any`    |

These can be called in a similar manner to their counterparts
in the standard library.

The `RcppNT2` package comes with a number of stand-alone 
examples -- please browse them
[here](https://github.com/RcppCore/RcppNT2/tree/master/inst/examples)
to get a feel for how the package can be used.

## Getting Started

You can install the RcppNT2 package from GitHub using devtools:

```r
devtools::install_github("RcppCore/RcppNT2")
```

### sourceCpp

Add the following to a standalone C++ source file to import RcppNT2:

```cpp
// [[Rcpp::depends(RcppNT2)]]
#include <RcppNT2.h>
```

When you compile a file using `Rcpp::sourceCpp()`, the
required compiler and linker settings for RcppNT2 will
be automatically included in the compilation.

Many of the optimizations underlying **NT<sup>2</sup>**
are made possible through the use of C++ template metaprogramming
techniques. As a consequence, it can often take a very long time
to compile translation units that include `<RcppNT2.h>`.

You can use `RcppNT2::precompileRcppNT2()` to generate a
[pre-compiled header](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Precompiled-Headers.html),
which `Rcpp::sourceCpp()` will automatically include and use
as appropriate. This can improve compile times by up to ~5x
in translation units including the `<RcppNT2.h>` header.

### R Packages

Because RcppNT2 is a header-only library, using it in client
R packages is easy. Just ensure you have the following in your
`DESCRIPTION` file:

```yaml
LinkingTo: RcppNT2, BH (>= 1.60.0)
SystemRequirements: C++11
```

After you've added the above to the package you can simply
include the main RcppNT2 package header in source files that
need to use it:

```cpp
#include <RcppNT2.h>
```
